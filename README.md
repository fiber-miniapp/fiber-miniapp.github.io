### Creating a news item

News items are implemented as "posts" in the Jekyll template
system. Each Jekyll post has its own file located at the _post
directory with its file name named as YYYY-MM-DD-title.md. It must
also have the preamble for posts as shown below:

    ---
    layout: post
    title: Post Title
    ---

See also the existing post files.

The list of all posts can be found at news.html. Additionally, the
recent five news items are automatically linked from the top page.
